## Project Description
The project is about the game Risk and its attack mechanics.
It's one of the most known games of strategy around the world, and its mechanics have been copied and adapted for many other games.

## Rules
Players set how many armies they posess.
The attacker can only attack with maximum 3 troops, and he has to leave 1 troop on the land he comes from.
The defender can only defend with maximum 2 troops.
If the attacker is succesfull, he will take the land the defender was occupying.

## Workflow
A dice roll generator is needed.
Every player will have a pool of dice.
Comparison of pools.
"Killing" soldiers.
New round.

## Organization
I used Trello to organize my work.

My repository only has two files: the main game file and a picture file.
